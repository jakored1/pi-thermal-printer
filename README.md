# Thermal Printer Present
### _Fun Photo/Text Thermal Printer Present_

##### Reason:
This project was made for a friend as a birthday gift.  
When starting the project the goal was to create a box with 5 buttons and a thermal printer popping out.  
When pressing one of the five buttons a photo or a text message will be printed from the printer accordingly.  
The project will also be able to work without any electricity outlet, so the box can be carried around freely!  
##### Background:
I came into this project with no background in electronics and such, I only knew some software.  
So I beleive this project isn't too challening and can be accomplished relativly easaly following this tutorial  
##### Credits:
To create this project I followed these tutorials:  
https://www.hackster.io/glowascii/using-a-thermal-printer-with-raspberry-pi-d74619  
https://learn.adafruit.com/networked-thermal-printer-using-cups-and-raspberry-pi/connect-and-configure-printer  
In this readme I'll explain how I combined the mentioned tutorials, the errors I ran into, how I solved them, hopefully allowing you to re-create this at home ðŸ˜„
